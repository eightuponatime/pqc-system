#+title: Plan
* Basic Kyber realization
[x] NTT forward/inverse
[ ] Polynomial multiplication with NTT
[ ] Compression/Decompression
[ ] Generating random polynomials (Sampling): CBD, Uniform sampling
[ ] Matrix-Vector operations (polyphase decomposition)
[ ] Hash functions for deterministic generations
[ ] General Kyber functions keygen(), encaps(), decaps()

* Polyhedral optimization
[x] NTT (forward and inverse transforms)
[ ] Pointwise multiplication
[ ] Matrix-vector mul (KeyGen: t = A·s + e)
[ ] Encrypt: u = A·r + e1, v = t·r + e2 + m
[ ] Decrypt: v - u·s
[ ] Add noise / mod reduction
[ ] Packing (partial, block-wise)

* criteries for FPGA
>= 90 000 - 100 000 LUT(Logic Cells)
>= 100 - 120 DSP (Hardware Units that increase multiplication speed)
>= 100 BRAM (Inregrated Memory)
>= 200 MHz (Minimum Possible Frequency)
